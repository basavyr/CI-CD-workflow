# CMake on CI/CD

Because most of my C++ projects are built with CMake, a completely dedicated repository for issues/guides/documentation and other sources was made, which can be accessed here:

### [CMAKE - DOCS](https://github.com/basavyr/c-cake-documentation-tutorials)

There are multiple links to various posts which help fixing issues while building a C++ project, but also some overall commands which provide a proper build environment.

* Example of `CMakeLists.txt` (build recipes) found in the `cmake` directory.
