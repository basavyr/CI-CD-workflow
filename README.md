# CI/CD Workflow with CircleCI and GitHub

A collection of sources, guides and config files for deployment of development projects with CI/CD.

The process of CI/CD during development stage of a `C++` or Python project implies building on each push (on any branch)

The repository contains various sources that help to develop a proper pipeline for [*CircleCI*](https://circleci.com/) and also [*GitHub Actions*](https://github.com/features/actions).

* Official GitHub Actions documentation: [here](https://help.github.com/en/actions)
